Python Maya lego peice generator

This Python script will produce various types of lego
pieces. The pieces have accurate dimensions according to the official lego pieces. This script adds a  
GUI that one can interact with to create the lego pieces.
The GUI should be easy to use.
I used the  GUI to create pieces to build an accurate
representation of a lego tech vehicle. The vehicle image example is included


When interacting with the GUI the following is true:

One chooses the color once which sets it for all the pieces.
To change the color they have to reselect the color. The basic block has a width and length. The
beams have a length chosen by slider. The angled beam you can also select between the angles
of 90 and 45. To create the wheel and hub, you only push a button and it is instantly created.

One can create basic lego blocks and beams as well as rounded beams.
